About Me
=========

__Hello World!__ 

<p>I'm Yuki Xu, I major in User Experience Design and aiming to minor in Psychology at <i>Wilfried Laurier University</i>. When I'm not working, you can find me drawing my next webcomic or hanging with friends and family.

I am currently a second year User Experience Design student at Wilfrid Laurier University. Although I am a beginner in many things, I am a rounded team player whoâ€™s interested and dabbles between technology and the arts; ranging from gamification to illustrations. The combination of these two subjects led me to discover the world of UXD/UI and I'm looking forward to be part of it!</p>
