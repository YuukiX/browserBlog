# Yearbook 
<h2>[2019]</h2>

<br/>
<p>
During my last year in high school I was part of yearbook, and my friend and I were given the opportunity to design the front and back cover of the yearbook. It was such an honour to work along with the <a href="https://www.herffjones.com/yearbook/" target="_blank">Herff Jones company</a> and it was insightful too. Since we did a good job, our teacher also recommended us to do the graduation booklet as well. 

Within the yearbook team, all of us worked together  to take pictures, decide themes and layouts, etc. We did not enjoy having to finish everything midway through second semester. There were times scheduling and meeting deadlines were hard but it all worked out in the end. My favorite part of the yearbook was the halloween page. We would have a photoshoot with students and staff in costume and some of them were truly amazing!

<h3>My angle</h3>

<p>Throughout the whole yearbook process, the most important skill I’ve participated and improved on was teamwork and collaboration. Working together was most necessary since we all were working towards the same goal, creating the best yearbook we can. Based on our skills, we divided up the work and communicated throughout the whole process. “By listening to each other's responses, people get a variety of ideas they did not think about for themselves” (Gilbert, Tozer, & Westoby, 2017). Not only did we communicate with our yearbook members but also our teachers and representatives from the Herff Jones Company. By collaborating with one another we were able to strengthen each other's skills and successfully publish our 2018-2019 yearbook.</p>
