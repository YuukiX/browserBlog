# McOuat Partnership 
<h2>[February 2018 - June 2018]</h2>
<br/>
<p>
During highschool, I was given the opportunity to be a co-op student at <a href="https://www.mcouatpartnership.com/" target="_blank">McOuat Partnership</a>. It was a great experience for me because from there I’ve learned so much about working within a workplace and discovered possibilities working in the field of graphic design. From there I was able to reconfigure and think of what kind of career was right for me. Some challenges for me were waking up early, starting work from 8:30am in the morning till lunch at noon, and feeling the pressure of deadlines from my supervisor. Despite that, I enjoyed small conversations with the staff, learning from them, and feeling accomplished after getting emails with approval from clients. My favourite part from this experience are the skills I've learned and the connections I've made!

<h3>My Angle</h3>

<p>From working as a co-op student, I was able to experience working within a professional workplace and be supervised by my supervisor along with the rest of the staff. I learned a lot of skills from working with them including time management skills, communication skills, and computer skills. Co-op provides student like me to “develop professional-level skills through multiple placements, enabling employers to give them a high level of responsibility and leading to more development of their professional skills and knowledge” (Ambrose & Popklop, 2015). It helped me provide real world experience and helped me figure out what I wanted to do in the future. </p>
