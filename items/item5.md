I started learning piano ever since I was in grade 1. I continued to have piano lessons up until around grade 5, but I had still participated playing in school bands and by myself at home. The piano was, and still is, a healthy hobby I like to do. I didn’t enjoy practicing piano for several hours per week, that’s one of the reasons why I quit piano lessons. I do enjoy when I learn songs that I enjoy to play and listen too. Ever since I quit, I learned piano by watching youtube tutorials and occasionally improvising my own chords/notes. I can now play anime and cartoon theme songs such as Pokemon and Gravity Falls! My favorite thing about playing the piano is that I can learn any song I wish to play and even play alongside with friends and family.
