During my last year in highschool, I got selected to participate in the Skills Ontario Competition at Seneca. I feel so nervous because I’ve never done anything like this (well, competitions in general). I was partnered with a fellow classmate and we entered for 3d animation, which is good because we were both learning how to use Maya. I did not enjoy how we had to read over the rules by ourselves and make 3D models beforehand, since we were both beginners at 3d modeling and animation. However I enjoyed the experience and being able to be part of a team that represented our school. It was fun to see everyone’s animations at the end and it was even nicer to receive medals! My favorite part from this trip was exploring seneca with friends.

<h3>My angle</h3>

<p>From this experience I was able to get out of my comfort zone and put my 3D modeling skills to the test, even though I was a beginner. It's important to encourage students like me to gain independence, personal growth, and self-directed learning (Lafrenz & Murray, 2005). From these competitions, students have the opportunity to have exposure to the field/subject and make connections with others. Likewise, those who enter and win those competitions would have the “....satisfaction in accomplishing individual goals to academic growth and development” (Lafrenz & Murray, 2005). Although it was nice to receive a medal, I was happy enough to be acknowledged, and enter the competition with fellow students to represent our school. Moreover, I loved having the opportunity to participate and view works from the other teams; learning from them as well.
