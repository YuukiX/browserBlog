# Hacking the box
<h2>[2020]</h2>

<br/>
<p>
For our Group Maker Project, we were tasked think of creative ideas to “hack” the traditional cardboard box and create a 3d prototype. Inspired by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/outofthebox/#:~:text=The%20Dezeen%20x%20Samsung%20Out,with%20prize%20money%20totalling%20%2420%2C000." target="_blank">Samsung’s Out of the Box Competition</a>, we wanted to re-purpose the box into a practical item. 

From brainstorming together as a group over Zoom, We noticed that during the pandemic people stayed indoors and order online more frequently; causing an increase of shipping boxes. We also notice many users use their laptops for work related activities. Using our user research we started ideating and came up with a solution, a DIY Laptop Stand.

<h3>Inspiration & Ideation</h3>
<p>Inspired by Samsung’s Out of the Box Competition, we wanted to repurpose the box into a practical item. We scheduled a zoom call to research and generate ideas. We noticed that because of COVID-19, made people had to stay indoors for extensive amounts of time which led to the uprise of online shopping. Many people, especially students, had to work at home and use their laptop on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Our Users</h3>
<p>

* Anyone that uses a laptop
* People of all ages
* DIY Lovers​
* Individuals that possess cardboard boxes
* Online shoppers
* People of all incomes
</p>

<h3>Prototyping</h3>
<p>Together, we came up with the blueprint of the design. The cardboard box would be scored slightly to provide guidelines to let users know what needs to be cut or folded and where the incisions need to be made. The entire stand can be built from just two separate pieces. The small tabs and holes to keep the box together so that no additional materials are needed to construct the laptop stand.</p>

<p>Using SketchUp, Elise created a digital 3D model of the laptop stand after it is folded. She also created a mock up of what the blueprint could look like on a box. By having the template printed onto the box (either inside or outside the box) we not only repurpose materials but also make it easily accessible for anyone to build it.</p>

<h3>My angle</h3>

<p>​<i>Why the lack of materials?​</i>

Since there's no need for tape or glue, users only need an exacto knife to cut out the pieces. We wanted to minimize the number of materials needed for construction so it can be more accessible. We want to provide users with the opportunity to start making something practical and sustainable, using materials they currently have and repurpose the cardboard box to reduce the waste of shipping boxes during the pandemic. Like in Langley’s, Turners, & Yoxall’s packaging research project (2011), we want to reuse waste materials and influence consumers' alternative waste route options.</p>
