# AchieveMore Education

<h4> Experience Grade: A </h4>

During the summer of 2016, I volunteered at AchieveMore Education’s summer camp as a coordinator and visual arts tutor. I filed folders, took attendance, helped staff members, assisted drawing classes, and even hosted a cupcake decorating event! It was good for me to experience more responsibility and take more initiative since I’m usually the shy type. It was hard being the only volunteer at that time and having to supervise all the children while they climbed all over me <i>(haha...)</i>. However, I had a lot of fun and got along with everyone. My favourite time was snack time because I partook in eating the snacks...
