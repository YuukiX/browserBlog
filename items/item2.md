# Hacking the box
<h2>[2020]</h2>

<p>
For our Group Maker Project, we were tasked think of creative ideas to “hack” the traditional cardboard box and create a 3d prototype. Inspired by [Samsung’s Out of the Box Competition](https://www.dezeen.com/outofthebox/#:~:text=The%20Dezeen%20x%20Samsung%20Out,with%20prize%20money%20totalling%20%2420%2C000.), we wanted to re-purpose the box into a practical item. 

From brainstorming together as a group over Zoom, We noticed that during the pandemic people stayed indoors and order online more frequently; causing an increase of shipping boxes. We also notice many users use their laptops for work related activities. Using our user research we started ideating and came up with a solution, a DIY Laptop Stand.
