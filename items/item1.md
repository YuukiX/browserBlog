<h4> Experience Grade: B+ </h4>

During highschool, I was given the opportunity to be a co-op student at [McOuat Partnership](https://www.mcouatpartnership.com/). It was a great experience for me because from there I’ve learned so much about working within a workplace and discovered possibilities working in the field of graphic design. From there I was able to reconfigure and think of what kind of career was right for me. Things I didn’t enjoy were waking up early, starting work from 8:30am in the morning, and feeling the pressure of deadlines from my supervisor. Despite that, I enjoyed small conversations with the staff, learning from them, and feeling accomplished after getting emails with approval from clients. My favourite part from this experience are the skills I've learned and the connections I've made!
