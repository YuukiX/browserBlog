For our Group Maker Project, we were tasked think of creative ideas to “hack” the traditional cardboard box and create a 3d prototype. Inspired by Samsung’s Out of the Box Competition, we wanted to re-purpose the box into a practical item. 

From brainstorming together as a group over Zoom, We noticed that during the pandemic people stayed indoors and order online more frequently; causing an increase of shipping boxes. We also notice many users use their laptops for work related activites. USing our user research we started ideating and came up with a solution, a DIY Laptop Stand.
