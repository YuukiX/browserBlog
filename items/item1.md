# Laurier Registration Guide
<h2>[2018]</h2>

<br/>
<p>
For our Design Foundations term project, our group was tasked by our clients ,Lori, Shelagh and Jennifer, to make the Laurier registration process easier for students and find solutions to their initial problems such as...

* Not enough students are using registration resources and tools
* Repetitively received lots of email and phone questions 

<i>"How might we streamline the process of course registration and reduce student confusion?"</i>
