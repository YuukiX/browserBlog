# Laurier Registration Guide
<h2>[2018]</h2>

<br/>
<p>
For our Design Foundations term project, our group was tasked by our clients, Lori, Shelagh and Jennifer, to make the Laurier registration process easier for students and find solutions to their initial problems such as...

* Not enough students are using registration resources and tools
* Repetitively received lots of email and phone questions 

<i>"How might we streamline the process of course registration and reduce student confusion?"</i>

<h2> Process </h2>

<h3>Research</h3>
We first started out with research. We conducted interviews with various students and fellow classmates. Many of them had no idea that there was a course registration guide. Many of them had trouble registering their first year courses as the process was confusing and unpleasant.
We then created a journey map so that we can visualize the user experience of course registration.

<h3>Ideation</h3>
After gathering research data about our users and the issues at hand, we started brainstorming as many ideas as possible.

<h3>My angle </h3>
It is important to make sure the process of school registration is as efficient as possible. Although registration is open months before the term starts, “more than one-quarter of new students do not register until the summer” (Fong & Faude, 2018). As a student, I know that many first year students put a lot of thought towards choosing their courses. Not to mention, trying to find the course requirements for their programs. I remember my experiences of registering was confusing and difficult. Doing this project we gave our insights and possible solutions to our clients, Lori, Shelagh and Jennifer in hopes that it can provide assistance to revising the current laurier registration guide. By doing so, our hope is that in the future the registration process would be more efficient, prevent late enrollments, and help students understand and be more confident in choosing their respective courses.
